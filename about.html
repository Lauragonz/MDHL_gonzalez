                    <p>
                        The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to
                        provide athletes residing Chicago's northside neighborhoods
                        an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a
                        member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and
                        reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran by o small
                        full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time
                        of parents and previous league members
