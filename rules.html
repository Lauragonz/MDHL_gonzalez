            <p>
                The common interest that members of the Association share is to
                inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
                play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator
                or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject
                to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                    DIMENSIONS.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
                    dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and
                    length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields
                    used by teams under 12 and older.

                    COMPETITION FIELDS. Fields used within the competition
                    program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues,
                    districts or associations participating in the state
                    competition program that are unable to provide a field that
                    meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                    Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
                    inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not
                    a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                    from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to
                    provide an acceptable field may be required to play all
